# Multi Shot Prompts on Language Models
## Objective:
In this exercise, we will explore how we can use some advanced prompting including Instruction tuning the model how to classify sentiments. We will then use the **GLUE** and **SST2** dataset to classify a batch of records for sentiments.  
We will also check the performance of our model on the classification task by using the "accuracy" metric"
